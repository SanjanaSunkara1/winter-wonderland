# ☃️ Winter Wonderland ☃️

#### 📋 Description:

This **This winter Graphic** is a fun, holiday themed visual that I have made using extensions in java such as `JFrame`, `Graphics`, and `Color`.

---

### ✨ File Desription:
**GraphicsDriver** -  This class extends `JFrame` and serves as the main window for the application. It sets up the frame, its size, and the default closing operation. It then adds the Snow object to the frame's content pane.

**Pumpkin** - This class primarily extends `Canvas` and is responsible for drawing the snowmans, trees, and the snow. The paint method, which is automatically invoked when the component needs to be drawn, is overridden to draw the ground, and some of the tree ornaments.

---

### ❄️ This Current Implementation Includes:
-A twilight-colored background.

-A string displaying "SANJANA's Carved Pumpkin!".

-Methods to draw the ground and the pumpkin.
